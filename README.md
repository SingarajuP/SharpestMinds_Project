## Overview

Reading books is a recreational activity. The reader will go through different emotions while reading a book. The feedback given as a review is based on the emotions they feel. These reviews are helpful for a user who wants to read a book. By analyzing the reviews given by different customers, we want to capture the emotions triggered for the book and the percentage of people who felt the same emotion.
