       "\"\\nIn all big cities there are self-contained groups that exist without intercommunication, small worlds within a greater world that lead their lives, their members dependent upon one another for companionship, as though they inhabited islands separated from each other by an unnavigable strait. Of no city, in my experience, is this more true than of Paris.\\n4 ½ stars. I liked this book a lot. Much more than Maugham's Of Human Bondage, but not quite as much as The Painted Veil. The first person minor perspective works really well here. Maugham inserts himself into the story, but mostly exists as an observer and messenger, retelling the tales passed to him by Elliott, Larry, Isabel and others. I think this is one of the most interesting narrative structures-- we are still a part of the story, not looking down on it, but we are also an outsider peering in. It seems to be exactly the right amount of proximity and distance to suit me.I also like Maugham best when he is fondly mocking human nature. Elliott has to be the most lovable snob I've ever had the pleasure of encountering. It is he that introduces the narrator to young couple, Larry and Isabel, and he isn't shy about his views on their impending marriage. In France, the only civilized country, Elliott says, Isabel would have the sense to marry Gray instead and take Larry as a lover.\\nWho could deny that Elliott, that arch-snob, was also the kindest, most considerate and generous of men?\\nThe story is about the journey of all these characters as they each pursue their own personal goals. Elliott's goal being social eminence, Isabel's wealth and comfort, and Larry's - perhaps most interesting of all - enlightenment and self-understanding. Larry is a fascinating character; a First World War veteran who comes back changed, but instead of responding to his brush with death by breaking down, he becomes curious about the world and people. He begins to care little for money and possessions, much to the chagrin of the affluent Americans around him. His need for understanding takes him across the world, finally landing him in India. Non-Western philosophy features a lot in Maugham's work, and here Brahmanism offers Larry a new perspective.Maugham's narration is chock-full of witty remarks that are genuinely very funny and have withstood the test of time. As usual, art and literature feature heavily, as do snobbery, social interactions and character drama. It's almost soapy, except it's a little too sophisticated for that. (But only a little.)\\n“And you call yourself an English gentlemen,” she exclaimed, savagely.“No, that’s a thing I’ve never done in all my life.”\\nI think I like Maugham so much because he's not particularly moralistic, and any character presenting themselves as holier-than-thou often gets a dressing down. His characters are alcoholics and prostitutes; they behave jealously and question religion. This is another reason I like Larry. For all his pursuit of understanding and rejection of material things, he remains non-judgmental of other characters. I'll be back for more of Maugham. I've heard The Moon and Sixpence is another good one.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube\""

       "'Books like this, that I’ve read so long ago in my past, come back even now to haunt me, like the lilting, plaintive refrain of an old Beatles Love song!But I only started it in the mid-seventies. Even back then, working in soulless offices, I needed to replenish my heart in long, lingering draughts. So how did I do that?If you guessed by hanging around bookstores you nailed it! There was a Centretown bookshop of irregular modern architectural design right at the hub of the nearby city - my wonderful Dad used to cuss and call it Confusion Square - a hub which would have been ironically termed the heart of the city.Cause it wasn’t. Postmodern cities are quite heartless, as their great refabricator Henri Lefebvre used to say.No: the heart of the city was its bookstores - this one, Classics (my fave chain back then) - and W.H. Smith, Coles, Prospero and later Chapters, all within that two- or three-block epicentre.Books, as I say, replenish my heart. Always have - ever since that halcyon summer’s day in 1956, when I took up Jules Verne, after digesting my Dick & Jane book in Grade One - and finally discovering reading.Since that time, books always seem to remind me of my Grandmother, whose literary spending habits were downright prodigal! And she got it from her hubby, my bibliophile Viennese Granddad...And of course they both passed that on to Mom, the village librarian, and her beloved children.Mom and Dad had (obliquely) introduced me to Maugham in 1957, I remember, and it was in the form of the then-popular Mr Maugham Himself, a late-life anthology in bite-sized chunks of reading. Mom was a great admirer of his books!And no, of course I didn’t actually Read Maugham back then, though my parents extolled his sophistication to the skies.And THIS book, the Razor’s Edge, I never finished until I was 56. I had just finished The Moon and Sixpence, which had left a foul taste on my mouth - but, no - I wasn’t about to give up so easily, because my parents swore by Maugham’s genius.And I remembered The Razor’s Edge GLARING down at me from the top of my piano, unfinished, in ‘76:“Read me! Read me!” it had seemed to scream out.And so, now, 30 years after that - having been burnt out in retirement, and being now browned off by my own disaster summed up in The Moon and Sixpence - I picked it up.And I remembered then... that in my twenties I had thought its hero, Larry, was me! Larry: the Good self I had almost lost along the way. At least that self was burned by years of passive, though conscientious objection to the Fire at the centre of our times.And I remembered that I DESPISED myself in my naive twenties for my passive betrayal of that self...Well, THIS time I loved the book. It was so ME, it wasn’t funny.For I was by now relearning my own version of the razor’s edge, my own straight and narrow path through the fire, and had been learning it since the nineties. Just like Larry.Now, looking back 15 years later, I see the book started an amazing process of Platonic recollection in my soul...Remembering all my lost beginnings and roads not taken, and straight paths discarded out of hand early on. And Virtues shrugged off as uncool.A process that made me come to gradually understand, through Larry, my OWN SPIRITUAL ODYSSEY -Its shaky conception; andIts happy, Peace-filled conclusion.Where I am NOW...Thank Heaven - and many thanks to you, Larry, also.'"

       "'Oh, Mr. Maugham, there are moments when I love you so much I could burst. Moments when I wish there were a six star rating, so I could put it into your hands and say \"I got that part and it resonated with me.\" Moments when I want to say, \"enough of that, get back to the story\", only to find That is the story, That is the heart.This novel made me wish to live in the post WWI twenties and have endless possibilities open to me. It made me examine the life I have lived and wonder if I couldn\\'t have gotten more out of it if I had been bolder or less worried.It\\'s strange how many people suffer from it (fear). I don\\'t mean fear of closed spaces and fear of heights, but fear of death and, what\\'s worse, fear of life. Often they\\'re people who seem in the best of health, prosperous, without any worry, and yet they\\'re tortured by it. I\\'ve sometimes thought it was the most besetting humour of men, and I asked myself at one time if it was due to some deep animal instinct that man has inherited from that primeval something that first felt the thrill of life.How any things have I not done in life because I was afraid to try them? More than a few I can remember. Here at the end, I wish I had been braver, bolder and, yes, a little crazier.This is surely amongst the best, if not the best, of Maugham\\'s works I have found so far. By inserting himself into the novel, he makes it seem so vital and real, and even while understanding it as a contrivance, it lends these characters heft and weight and importance. For each of them, life is about choices and one has to question which of these characters is the most fulfilled. In the end we are told they all got what they wanted, but did they? Eliot wants to be very important, but is he? Does anyone truly want death? Should we choose security over adventure and love? Is a higher truth worth striving for? Can a man ever identify and know God?The Maugham who is a character in this book is only an observer, no wiser than the others, unable to give us the answers and willing to accept the failures. The Maugham who wrote this book is wise and savvy and enlightened. He knows. This book is like an onion. I kept peeling it back to find another layer, and another layer, and a layer deeper even than that.Unless love is passion, it\\'s not love, but something else, and passion thrives not on satisfaction, but on impediment. What d\\'you suppose Keats meant when he told the lover on his Grecian urn not to grieve? \\'Forever wilt thou love, and she be fair!\\' Why? Because she was unattainable, and however madly the lover pursued she still eluded him.Perhaps true knowledge is as unattainable as love, always more to know, always another place to seek in, always a little out of our reach. In the hands of God, who might reveal it to us at the moment of our deaths or might send us back to strive again and again until we have gotten it right.'"
