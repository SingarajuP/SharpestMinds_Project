       "'In 1919 war hero Larry (Laurence) Darrell returns to his hometown of Chicago, wounded twice, the brave aviator, has a deeper injury which changes him considerably. A comrade saved his life but lost his, over France, dying on the cold ground. Isabel Bradley, Larry\\'s faithful fiancee notices the alteration .When his best friend Gay Maturin, gets his millionaire father Henry to offer his pal a good job. Darrell turns it down, he doesn\\'t want to sell bonds, who does ? Still you can make a lot of lovely money, in the roaringera of wealth, naturally some acceptable dissipation occurs by hungry men, for the mighty dollar . W.Somerset Maugham the famous British author is visiting the windy city ( yes, he the novelist puts himself in the story) . Another of his books, \"The Moon and Sixpence\", has just been published and is an unexpected bestseller. Doing interviews with the local newspapers, Maugham gets an invitation to have lunch with Elliott Templeton, an old friend and Isabel\\'s rich uncle. Elliott lives in Paris and comes home to see his family, Maugham the great writer, resides mostly in France too. Mr.Templeton is a big snob and proud of it, he nevertheless surprisingly... also a kind man, loves High Society and thinks Paris is the only place to live. Later Maugham has dinner with all the main characters, at Isabel\\'s mother\\'s home, Elliott\\'s sister (the author insists that this is a true story, we will never know for sure). Sophie, Isabel\\'s childhood friend, talks to the writer, a shy teenager. She is in love with Larry and Gay with Isabel, Sophie, Isabel and Larry, all have known each other since they were children in school. Everyone there tells the veteran, be smart, be a man and sell bonds...Larry is suffering from war shock... one of the many names, which future wars will apply different labels to, this tragic illness. Not strangely however but understandable, the former intrepid pilot has seen plenty... enough gore, and never glorious death, for anyone to stomach in a lifetime...instead... just wants to loaf. After joining up in Canada, the air corps in France, at seventeen ( he\\'s now 20), in the unmourned, horrific, bloody long ago conflict, 100 years old in the past...now decides to go back to Paris for two years, to forget and live on his small inheritance. Explaining to the not very understanding Isabel,\"The Dead look so terribly dead when they\\'re dead\". Many years after, they all will meet again, in a seedy Paris nightclub, Larry roams the world and looks like a bum, trying to find a reason for life. Takes a job as a coal miner, for the experience, stays at a monastery for months, seeing if inner peace can be achieved there, of course it probably never does. Even visits faraway, exotic India, and a famous, charismatic Yogi. Saintliness, is how Larry describes the man in a loincloth, however can Darrell ever find the happiness he desperately seeks ? A book for the adventurous, not of the lands of the Earth, but a bigger territory...the mind.'"

       "'A Timeless, stirring drama, scaling the heights of ecstasy to the dregs of utter despair.\"The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard.\" (Paraphrased from the Katha Upanishad)Larry Darrell is a likable fellow, engaged to young socialite, Isabel Bradley. Larry goes off to war, but returns a changed man. He breaks his engagement to Isabel and leaves his former life behind, and sets off on a series of spiritual quests. (My teen self fell in love with the ideal that was Larry Darrell!)Larry Darrell was as close to Nirvana as a human could be, according to the narrator in this story. I just saw Larry as a simple, decent person who took life as it came and made the best of things, refusing to be sucked into the sham that was success and social status.There were a few somewhat decent movie adaptations of this book, but I was totally upset when comedian Bill Murray was cast in the part of the luminous Larry Darrell. Talk about miscasting: it put Larry in a totally foolish, bumbling light! Catherine Hicks and Theresa Russell were excellent as Isabel and the tragic Sophie. Sophie\\'s character stayed with me long after I finished this story: in the beginning, she had the perfect life. But her happiness would be painfully fleeting: she lost her adoring husband and sweet little baby in an accident and turned to alcohol and drugs to dull her pain. Maugham described her fall from the sublime to the dregs so eloquently and with such moving compassion. This was a stirring melodrama that often had me on the edge of my seat. I didn\\'t know what to make of the ending, but I was so very young at the time. Now, I would just turn the page, sigh, and say: such a thrilling life! Highly recommended!'"

       "'In Asian countries, the custom of “home leaving” is not as common as it used to be, but it is ingrained in the culture deeply enough that it’s not yet considered weird. Home-leaving essentially means literally leaving your home, but also your secular life, in order to go on a spiritual journey, maybe even go live in a monastery and take vows and be ordained. There is no equivalency to this custom in Western civilization: usually, people who leave everything behind to go look for the meaning of life are considered to be a little crazy (or cashing in on the trendiness of mindfulness and enlightenment). As a culture, we’ve actually gotten a bit cynical about it, and with reason. But that quest can certainly be genuine, and the cultural bias against it probably intimidates a lot of people who could greatly benefit from giving it all up for a while and trying to see beyond the world they were raised in.This simple yet astonishingly layered novel by Mr. Maugham is about a man who goes on such a quest, maybe one of the first “white dude goes to India to look for the meaning of life” story in English literature. I didn’t know anything about the plot before I picked it up, and I’m going to try and not give anything away in this review because I am sure that experiencing this novel with as few expectations as possible is the best way to experience it.Larry is a smart and sensitive but directionless young man. After a traumatizing experience in service during WWI, he comes back to the United States incapable of fitting into the societal mold his guardian and fiancée try to force him in. He can’t go back to school or get a job. He doesn’t quite fit in with his old crowd either, they seem preoccupied by things that make no sense to him, like marriage, money, social status – and none of them understand why he won’t try to cash in on the wonderful potential he has to be an early 20th century American success. Larry’s aimlessness eventually leads him to leave his lovely fiancée Isabel behind as he goes off to Europe, and eventually Asia to quench what we recognize today as a spiritual need that his society cannot satisfy. Dejected, Isabel marries Gray, an old friend she has affection but no passion for, and it will be years before she crosses Larry’s path again. Their story is told to us directly by Maugham, who in a very post-modern manner, makes himself a part of his narrative: he meets Larry and Isabel through his friend, the charming but inveterate snob Elliot Templeton, and crosses paths with them many times through years and travels, and they catch him up on their lives with each encounter. This makes the book feel like a quiet and introspective study of human emotions through the lens of friendly gossip, peppered liberally with Maugham’s amazing wit and delightful prose.While I was reading “The Razor’s Edge”, I caught myself thinking that this is a book for grown-ups. Not because it has dirty stuff in it, though the characters talk quite frankly about sex, for a novel published in the 40s, but because I don’t think the events it describes could be empathized with by teenagers. Heartbreaking and life-changing decisions such as the ones made by Larry, Isabel, Gray and Sophie are the kind that gives adulthood its true meaning. Leaving someone you are still in love with, understanding that the weight of your responsibility is greater than your personal satisfactions, dreading irrelevancy in other people’s lives, grieving until your own welfare doesn’t matter... That is some grown-up stuff.I was very interested in Larry’s musings about religion, God and the meaning of life, as well as our place in it. His perspective and interrogations echo my own thoughts on those subjects, and it was fascinating to read those words, written more than 70 years ago because they felt very fresh, very modern and very relevant. I do believe that it is important to think critically about your own culture and to be constantly curious until you can find something that makes sense to you.Maugham’s work never ceases to amaze me, and each of his novels that I have read has taken me to an unexpected and deeply affecting place. I am starting to think that no one does characters just like he did, because seldom to I encounter characters that are so human, so flawed, so tragically real – and who’s struggle cracks my heart like an egg. But most importantly, his characters are beautifully layered confections – that may or may not be real people, and the beauty of the way they are written is that you can’t help but feel deep compassion for them: they may not be great people, but you never get a sense that he looks down on them, that their immoral actions are held against them or judged. Sophie’s terrible downward spiral and relapse are described with shocking frankness, but the reaction Maugham teases out of the reader is not disgust, but sadness and an urge to grab the poor woman and give her a hug and a helping hand.This was a wonderful read, subtle, funny and bittersweet. I absolutely loved it.'"

       "\"I didn't love it as much as I expected. The premise that Eastern philosophy has something to offer us in the West just isn't as novel as when this book was originally published. Maugham's description of upper crust society in Paris is bitchy and wonderfully astute at times. But, like most authors, he found it easier to describe the sinners than the saints. Larry Darrell, the saint of this book, just doesn't seem human or interesting. He and his quest for enlightenment and/or belief in God are one big yawnfest. All Maugham can do is describe Larry's scintillating eyes and his smile over and over and over again and by the end of the book, even Maugham is apologizing for that. Also, Maugham allows himself to be the first person narrator and, as such, does more than his fair share of self-aggrandizing in the book. He befriends prostitutes down on their luck, flies to the deathbed of people he's mildly acquainted with and even pays the funeral expenses of heroin-addicted nymphomaniacs. What a prince. The female cast of characters can pretty much be summed up as a gay man's view of women (Maugham was bisexual, I think, but leaned more towards men) Not terribly flattering or fleshed out to say the least.Women reading this book should glean three lessons from it: 1)It's not much fun to date a saint unless you get a kick out of living like a hobo and discussing 16th century mystics late into the night. (2) Don't stay engaged to a man who won't tell you where he lives. And finally....(3) Never, ever tell your love problems to a novelist because nothing good will come of it!\""

       "'\"One of Maugham\\'s three major novels ...\" TIME. That\\'s high praise coming from TIME magazine. This MUST be good.I’m sure some of you are familiar with a little American television drama series that aired on HBO from 2002-2008 called The Wire. I was way late to the party, but over the past 6 months or so, I’ve managed to watch all 5 glorious seasons back to back to back. Well, glorious to a point. But what the hell happened in season 5? I kept waiting for it to get good, kept waiting for something to happen. Waiting for the outlaw Omar Little to come along, whistling ‘The Farmer in the Dell,’ and take that bitch Marlo down. Man. Talk about anticlimactic. How you gonna do Omar like that, huh?I had a similar experience with this book. I was really digging it for about 200 pages. Then an unfortunate thing happened…I forgive the weirdness of Maugham interjecting himself as a minor character in the story and the weirdness of him being the narrator. I forgive the implausibility of every character just happening to feel the need to unburden themselves in his presence, whether they really knew him or not. What I cannot forgive is this:I feel it right to warn the reader that he can very well skip this chapter without losing the thread of such story as I have to tell, since for the most part it is nothing more than the account of a conversation that I had with Larry. I should add, however, that except for this conversation I should perhaps not have thought it worth while to write this book.What? What the What??? Well of course I have to read it now that you’ve said “(blah blah blah) except for this conversation I should perhaps not have thought it worth while to write this book.” But good God man, I wish I hadn’t. That was just awful. All that bullshit Eastern philosophy seemed so contrived. I think Maugham got confused for a moment there and thought he was Hermann Hesse. He is not Hermann Hesse. No one wants him to be Herman Hesse. I loved that the main character (Larry Darrell) was going through his own ‘Eat, Pray, Love’ spiritual journey type thing, travelling from country to country trying to find his own version of Truth. I loved him, and I loved the way he eschewed all of the so called social norms and expectations and did his own thing. But that whole conversation was just plain hackneyed and I wish I had never read it. Minus that chapter, this is definitely a 4 star book. But quite honestly, I was sitting in a park reading the chapter that INSPIRED THE BOOK and I almost threw it in the garbage can unfinished. I’m just bitterly trying to pretend that chapter never happened. If I could do it all again, I’d be like that annoying little kid who doesn’t want to listen to his mother, with his fingers in his ears going “la la la laaaa.. I can’t hear you.\" The end.'"

       "'Back in the dark days of the mid-’80s, I read somewhere that Bill Murray was going to be in a movie called The Razor’s Edge, and that it was based on a book. Since this was long before the days where you could check IMDB to see what the movie was going to be about, I figured the book had to be hilarious since Murray was starring in it. So I found the book at the library and started reading. I was pretty shocked to find that it was a serious story about a guy who goes looking for the meaning of life. I was even more shocked that I loved it. And even though the movie version flopped and caused Murray to drop out of film making for years, I still want to say thanks to Bill because if it wasn’t for the movie, I probably never would have read this.Maugham engages in a bit of meta-fiction by incorporating himself into a story he claims at the beginning was true. (I guess there’s been a fair amount of debate on if it actually was based on fact, but I’m content to consider it fiction.) Maugham is friends with Elliot Templeton, an American born snob whose passion is for European high society. Maugham meets Templeton’s relatives while on a trip to Chicago, including Elliot’s niece, Isabel. Isabel is engaged to Larry Darrell. (Feel free to insert your own jokes about “Hi, I’m Larry. This is my brother Darrell, and my other brother Darell.”) Larry was a World War I pilot who is driving Isabel’s family crazy with his continued refusal to get a job and start grabbing some of that postwar prosperity that the rest of America is cashing in on.Over the course of the next two decades, Maugham will learn the story of Larry and Isabel from updates by Elliot and chance encounters with the people involved. Larry and Isabel break their engagement, and Larry travels the world, taking different jobs and doing extensive research on varying subjects without explaining why. Eventually, Maugham learns that the war gave Larry a burning desire to explore the nature of existence and eventually leads him to India where he‘d try to find enlightenment.Re-reading this, a couple of things struck me about why it appeals to me. The first is the character of Larry. The idea of a character profoundly changed by war isn’t anything new, but Larry comes across as distinct and unique. He isn’t bitter or angry. He isn’t seeking solace in booze or sex or turning into a raging nihilist. Larry comes across as a curious person who was genuinely puzzled about the nature of death and evil, and decides to look for his own answers. His ability to withstand the overwhelming peer pressure to follow his friends into jobs shows his will to follow his own path, but Larry isn’t looking down his nose at anyone. He doesn’t judge others and is content to live his own life in the way he’s chosen. As another character describes Larry, he’s a very religious man who doesn’t believe in God, and that’s a really great character to read about.The other thing I like is the structure of the novel. Telling the story over a period of years, sometimes as second hand stories told to Maugham was a way to make you curious about Larry and his quest, and Maugham’s talent makes the other characters and subplots come alive.
