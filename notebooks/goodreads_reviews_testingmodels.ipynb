       "'A Timeless, stirring drama, scaling the heights of ecstasy to the dregs of utter despair.\"The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard.\" (Paraphrased from the Katha Upanishad)Larry Darrell is a likable fellow, engaged to young socialite, Isabel Bradley. Larry goes off to war, but returns a changed man. He breaks his engagement to Isabel and leaves his former life behind, and sets off on a series of spiritual quests. (My teen self fell in love with the ideal that was Larry Darrell!)Larry Darrell was as close to Nirvana as a human could be, according to the narrator in this story. I just saw Larry as a simple, decent person who took life as it came and made the best of things, refusing to be sucked into the sham that was success and social status.There were a few somewhat decent movie adaptations of this book, but I was totally upset when comedian Bill Murray was cast in the part of the luminous Larry Darrell. Talk about miscasting: it put Larry in a totally foolish, bumbling light! Catherine Hicks and Theresa Russell were excellent as Isabel and the tragic Sophie. Sophie\\'s character stayed with me long after I finished this story: in the beginning, she had the perfect life. But her happiness would be painfully fleeting: she lost her adoring husband and sweet little baby in an accident and turned to alcohol and drugs to dull her pain. Maugham described her fall from the sublime to the dregs so eloquently and with such moving compassion. This was a stirring melodrama that often had me on the edge of my seat. I didn\\'t know what to make of the ending, but I was so very young at the time. Now, I would just turn the page, sigh, and say: such a thrilling life! Highly recommended!'"

       "\"I didn't love it as much as I expected. The premise that Eastern philosophy has something to offer us in the West just isn't as novel as when this book was originally published. Maugham's description of upper crust society in Paris is bitchy and wonderfully astute at times. But, like most authors, he found it easier to describe the sinners than the saints. Larry Darrell, the saint of this book, just doesn't seem human or interesting. He and his quest for enlightenment and/or belief in God are one big yawnfest. All Maugham can do is describe Larry's scintillating eyes and his smile over and over and over again and by the end of the book, even Maugham is apologizing for that. Also, Maugham allows himself to be the first person narrator and, as such, does more than his fair share of self-aggrandizing in the book. He befriends prostitutes down on their luck, flies to the deathbed of people he's mildly acquainted with and even pays the funeral expenses of heroin-addicted nymphomaniacs. What a prince. The female cast of characters can pretty much be summed up as a gay man's view of women (Maugham was bisexual, I think, but leaned more towards men) Not terribly flattering or fleshed out to say the least.Women reading this book should glean three lessons from it: 1)It's not much fun to date a saint unless you get a kick out of living like a hobo and discussing 16th century mystics late into the night. (2) Don't stay engaged to a man who won't tell you where he lives. And finally....(3) Never, ever tell your love problems to a novelist because nothing good will come of it!\""
