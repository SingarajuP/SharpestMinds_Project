       "\"\\nIn all big cities there are self-contained groups that exist without intercommunication, small worlds within a greater world that lead their lives, their members dependent upon one another for companionship, as though they inhabited islands separated from each other by an unnavigable strait. Of no city, in my experience, is this more true than of Paris.\\n4 ½ stars. I liked this book a lot. Much more than Maugham's Of Human Bondage, but not quite as much as The Painted Veil. The first person minor perspective works really well here. Maugham inserts himself into the story, but mostly exists as an observer and messenger, retelling the tales passed to him by Elliott, Larry, Isabel and others. I think this is one of the most interesting narrative structures-- we are still a part of the story, not looking down on it, but we are also an outsider peering in. It seems to be exactly the right amount of proximity and distance to suit me.I also like Maugham best when he is fondly mocking human nature. Elliott has to be the most lovable snob I've ever had the pleasure of encountering. It is he that introduces the narrator to young couple, Larry and Isabel, and he isn't shy about his views on their impending marriage. In France, the only civilized country, Elliott says, Isabel would have the sense to marry Gray instead and take Larry as a lover.\\nWho could deny that Elliott, that arch-snob, was also the kindest, most considerate and generous of men?\\nThe story is about the journey of all these characters as they each pursue their own personal goals. Elliott's goal being social eminence, Isabel's wealth and comfort, and Larry's - perhaps most interesting of all - enlightenment and self-understanding. Larry is a fascinating character; a First World War veteran who comes back changed, but instead of responding to his brush with death by breaking down, he becomes curious about the world and people. He begins to care little for money and possessions, much to the chagrin of the affluent Americans around him. His need for understanding takes him across the world, finally landing him in India. Non-Western philosophy features a lot in Maugham's work, and here Brahmanism offers Larry a new perspective.Maugham's narration is chock-full of witty remarks that are genuinely very funny and have withstood the test of time. As usual, art and literature feature heavily, as do snobbery, social interactions and character drama. It's almost soapy, except it's a little too sophisticated for that. (But only a little.)\\n“And you call yourself an English gentlemen,” she exclaimed, savagely.“No, that’s a thing I’ve never done in all my life.”\\nI think I like Maugham so much because he's not particularly moralistic, and any character presenting themselves as holier-than-thou often gets a dressing down. His characters are alcoholics and prostitutes; they behave jealously and question religion. This is another reason I like Larry. For all his pursuit of understanding and rejection of material things, he remains non-judgmental of other characters. I'll be back for more of Maugham. I've heard The Moon and Sixpence is another good one.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube\""
